Statistics and probablity exercises (Probability distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing)
***
I'm doing this repository to practice statistics and probability exercises in python (Jupyter Notebooks); you will can find exercises about:
* [Probability Distributions](https://github.com/mvelezg99/probability-statistics-python/blob/master/exercises/Ejercicios%20distribuciones%20de%20probabilidad.ipynb)
* [Confidence Intervals Estimation](https://github.com/mvelezg99/probability-statistics-python/blob/master/exercises/Confidence%20Intervals%20Estimation.ipynb)
* [Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/mvelezg99/probability-statistics-python/blob/master/exercises/Hypothesis%20Testing.ipynb)
* [ANOVA (Analysis Of Variance)](https://github.com/mvelezg99/probability-statistics-python/blob/master/exercises/ANOVA.ipynb)
* [Simple Linear Regression](https://github.com/mvelezg99/probability-statistics-python/blob/master/exercises/Linear%20Regression.ipynb)

Also you can find a library [`mstats`](https://github.com/mvelezg99/probability-statistics-python/tree/master/resources/mstats) that I've made to solve this exercises.
In which there are functions in **python** to make some bother operations.
